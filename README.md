# Black Hole Mergers in Holographic Space-time (HST) Models of Inflation

Below, I explain the code that helped Dr. [Tom Banks](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/people/hpgs/BanksT.html) and I reach conclusions for our paper. 

The first code, 'BlackHoleMergers', was used to determine if black holes merged under specific initial conditions, like mass/energy density, velocity, and lattice spacing. There are three types of black holes:

* Interior: not on a face/edge/vertex of the initial toroidal lattice.
* Boundary: half of the black holes on faces/edges/vertices.
* Mirror: the ther half of the black holes on faces/edges/vertices. Due to the metric of the system, these represent the same black holes as the boundary ones. This technique (**method of images**) is used to make force calculations and merging easier.

In essence, this is an N-Body simulation, where we start with particles equally spaced within and on a cube. However, this code has a lot of extra methods for our purposes. Some of these include:

1. `torus`: this method helps maintain a 3 dimensional torus topology. Simply put, if a particle leaves our cube from one side, then this method will make sure that it moves back into the cube from the diameterically opposite side. It is important to note that the only such black holes considered by this method are boundary particles and their mirrors.

2. `distance`: this is a helper method for the `merge` method. This creates a 2D array with the distance between all particle pairs. Then, an array or zeros is created to check if black holes are close enough to merge. If so, a 1 is placed at the particle's index of this new array. 

3. `merge`: this method uses `distance` to carry out the merge. If that method's second array contains a one at that spot, it gets rid of one of the two particles and updates the other with a new position, velocity, and mass. Based on the type of particles merging, this also merges boundary/mirror black holes.

The rest of the code is just initializing various parameters like position and velocity, and then using leapfrog integration to update aforementioned parameters every timestep. The only additional element to this is the expansion of the universe. When the scale factor reaches 2 after being updated by Friedmann's equation, it is reset to 1 and all positions are doubled. This process is set to occur 9 more times. 

After running the code, we came to the conclusion that black holes have a very low chance of merging in this setting. More information about our results and the code can be found in our paper.

The second code, 'Macroscopic', was used to determine if groups of black holes would be bound together. This was done by using RUnge Kutta 4 to update some variables and check if a particle at $x = R$ reaches $x = 0$ from Newton's law of gravity. A graph of the results can be seen here:
